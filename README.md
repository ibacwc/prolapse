# prolapse ðŸ‘…
cmd tool for making timelapses in linux/bsd, supports wayland + X11 
(tested on Void Linux + FreeBSD)

# Install & Dependencies
**must** have *bash, scrot*(or *grim*, if wayland) and *ffmpeg*
example of those packages on void:
```# xbps-install -S bash scrot ffmpeg```
after that just download the script, then
```$ chmod +x prolapse.sh```
and run the thing
```$ ./prolapse.sh -h```
all there is to it
